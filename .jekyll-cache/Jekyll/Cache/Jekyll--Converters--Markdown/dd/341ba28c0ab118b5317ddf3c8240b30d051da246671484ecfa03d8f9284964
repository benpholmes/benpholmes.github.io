I"ÿ<p><strong>I</strong>
From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beautyâ€™s Rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feedâ€™st thy lightâ€™s flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
Thou that art now the worldâ€™s fresh ornament,
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
And tender churl makâ€™st waste in niggarding:
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
  To eat the worldâ€™s due, by the grave and thee.</p>

<p><strong>II</strong>
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beautyâ€™s field,
Thy youthâ€™s proud livery so gazed on now,
Will be a tatterâ€™d weed of small worth held:
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deservâ€™d thy beautyâ€™s use,
If thou couldst answer â€˜This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,â€™
Proving his beauty by succession thine!
  This were to be new made when thou art old,
  And see thy blood warm when thou feelâ€™st it cold.</p>

<p><strong>III</strong>
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another;
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
For where is she so fair whose unearâ€™d womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
Of his self-love to stop posterity?
Thou art thy motherâ€™s glass and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
  But if thou live, rememberâ€™d not to be,
  Die single and thine image dies with thee.</p>
